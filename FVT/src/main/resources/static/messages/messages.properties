# Extra information messages
extrainfo.question.1 = What FVT offers?
extrainfo.response.1 = FVT is able to show the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list and their information. With this information, FVT looks for a vulnerabilities that could be matched with some of your software, furthermore, it can alert to you if this happened (notification and email). Finally, FVT has a dashboard where you can see metrics and summaries about what is happening with the security of your devices.
extrainfo.question.2 = How FVT works?
extrainfo.response.2 = The logged user have to create a tracking in order to start the surveillance of a software. To help in this task, FVT has a help section where you could find the command to run and showing the specific software name installed in their devices. Once the user has the tracking list, he can create alarms for each tracking, so that, if a software become vulnerable, an alert is through. The user has the possibility of checking the general status of his software in the dashboard view. 
extrainfo.question.3 = Where does it get the information from?
extrainfo.response.3 = Currently, FVT takes its resources from CVE web. It downloads periodically the vulnerabilities list, processed it and, finally, stored it in its dabatase. This period is configurable by the user, since it is a heavy task.
extrainfo.question.4 = Which is the FVT goal?
extrainfo.response.4 = FVT doesn't want to be the definite tool for the enterprise environment security, but rather, a tool for little and medium enterprise where it is not possible to pay for expensives software to protect their devices. FVT want to be a baseline, a software that guaranteed a set of minimum security items. For this reason, FVT is available to download, install and distribute. 
extrainfo.question.5 = Is FVT an antivirus?
extrainfo.response.5 = It is not. FVT is focused in the protection against software vulnerabilities. An antivirus protects against malicious software, while FVT alerts you when a legitimate software has a security problem and could be the cause of an attack. FVT and antivirus are complementary softwares, not exclusive.
